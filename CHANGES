Changes file for OpenFrame::AppKit:

3.03
	  - bumped up version to 3.03 because some of the module
    	    versions were retrograding.  It was becoming a bit of
    	    a pain, and was far easier to make everything higher than
      	    the highest version of any module.  Pointed out by
    	    Randal Schwartz.
  	  - Added Pipeline-3.01 to dependencies.

1.04 (NOT RELEASED YET)
	- added OpenFrame::AppKit::Segment::DispatchOnURI, which allows
	  standard segments to be handle uri information rather than
          only those inheriting from OpenFrame::AppKit::App
	- better test coverage (checking sessions)
	- removed dead code from OpenFrame::AppKit::Examples::Hangman
	  noticed by Paul Makepeace

	- added Andrew Ford's patch to have state settings in
	  entry_points
